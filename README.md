Guide to accessing Google's AI search labs at school.
## Adding another account
I have made a guide on this but here it is again:

### Step 1
To get started, you need to have an extra Google account.

1. Go to Settings (on your chromebook) and go to Accounts.
2. Then, click on your name and "Add Google Account"
3. Login as normal and you have successfully added the Google account!

> [!NOTE]  
> Some schools may or may not allow you to add new Google accounts. In that case, you're screwed.

## Accessing the account on Google
Schools have this thing where when you try to sign in using the regular button, it still wont let you. So we gotta find another way to access them.

### Step 2
1. First, head to Google.
```
https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on
```

2. To the URL, add `authuser=1&`
```
https://www.google.com/?authuser=1&safe=active&ssui=on
```

3. From here, you should be in the Google homepage on your new account.

4. Click the bottle at the top next to the "Apps" button.

5. Scroll down, and add extensions!

> [!TIP]
> Using the `authuser=1` exploit, you can also access other Google services. But you can always use the other method if you want.
